## Explanation

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - An integer array `ans` of size 2 is initialized to store the indices of the numbers that satisfy the condition.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - Iterates through the `nums` array with index `i` from `0` to `nums.length - 1`.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - For each element in `nums`, another loop starts with index `j` set to `i + 1`, iterating through the elements that come after `nums[i]`.
   - This ensures that no element is paired with itself and that all possible pairs are checked.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - Inside the inner loop, the code checks if the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` equals the `target`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, the indices `i` and `j` are stored in the `ans` array.

5. **Early Return**:
   - Once a valid pair is found, the function immediately returns the `ans` array, ensuring minimal computation.

6. **Default Return**:
   - While the problem guarantees a solution, the code includes a fallback return statement. This handles any edge cases in scenarios where the problem constraints are relaxed.

### Example Walkthrough

**Input**:
```java
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
```

**Execution**:
- Outer loop starts with `i = 0` (`nums[i] = 2`).
- Inner loop starts with `j = 1` (`nums[j] = 7`).
- `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`, which matches the `target`.
- Indices `[0, 1]` are stored in `ans` and returned.

**Output**:
[0, 1]


## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Outer Loop**: Runs `n` times.
- **Inner Loop**: Runs `n - 1` times, `n - 2` times, ..., down to `1`.
- **Total**: The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `nums` array.

### Space Complexity
- The algorithm uses an array `ans` of size 2 to store the result.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) (constant space).
