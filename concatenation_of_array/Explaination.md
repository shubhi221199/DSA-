# Explanation of the `getConcatenation` Method

The `getConcatenation` method in the given Java code takes an integer array `nums` and returns a new array that is the concatenation of `nums` with itself. 

## Code Walkthrough

### Method Signature

```java
public int[] getConcatenation(int[] nums)
This method is public and returns an integer array (int[]). It takes one argument, nums, which is an array of integers.

Step 1: Initialize Variables
java
Copy code
int n = nums.length;
int ans[] = new int[2 * n];
int index = 0;
int n = nums.length;

This line stores the length of the nums array in the variable n. The length is used to determine the size of the resulting array.
int ans[] = new int[2 * n];

A new array ans is created with a size of 2 * n, meaning the array will have twice as many elements as nums (for concatenation).
int index = 0;

This variable is initialized to 0. It will be used to iterate over the nums array again when copying elements to the second half of the ans array.
Step 2: Copy the Original Array to the First Half of ans
java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ans[i] = nums[i];
}
This loop iterates through the nums array and copies each element into the first half of the ans array. The first n elements of ans are now filled with the elements of nums.
Step 3: Copy the Original Array to the Second Half of ans
java
Copy code
for (int i = n; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    ans[i] = nums[index];
    index++;
}
This loop starts from index n (the middle of the ans array) and continues to 2 * n - 1. The second half of the ans array is filled with the same elements from nums.
The index variable is incremented with each iteration to ensure that elements are copied from nums starting from the beginning.
Step 4: Return the Concatenated Array
java
Copy code
return ans;
Finally, the ans array, which now contains two copies of nums, is returned.
Example
Letâ€™s walk through an example to see how the code works.

Input:
java
Copy code
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
n will be 3 (length of nums).
The array ans is initialized with size 6 (2 * 3).
The first loop copies 1, 2, 3 from nums into ans, so ans becomes {1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0}.
The second loop copies 1, 2, 3 from nums again, so ans becomes {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}.
The array ans is returned.
Output:
java
Copy code
int[] result = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3};
Time Complexity
Both for-loops iterate over the entire array nums once.
Each loop runs for n iterations, so the total time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the nums array.
Space Complexity
The ans array is of size 2 * n, so the space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the nums array.
