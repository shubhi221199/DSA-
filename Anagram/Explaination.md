This code checks if two strings, `s1` and `s2`, are **anagrams** of each other. Two strings are considered anagrams if they contain the same characters with the same frequency, but possibly in a different order (e.g., "listen" and "silent").

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code:

### Method Overview

The method `areAnagrams` takes two strings, `s1` and `s2`, as input and returns a boolean (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the two strings are anagrams.

### Steps Explained

1. **Convert Strings to Character Arrays:**
   ```java
   char[] strArray1 = s1.toCharArray();
   char[] strArray2 = s2.toCharArray();
   ```
   - Strings `s1` and `s2` are converted into arrays of characters (`char[]`) using the `toCharArray()` method. This is done because individual characters of a string can be manipulated and compared more easily as arrays.

---

2. **Sort the Character Arrays:**
   ```java
   Arrays.sort(strArray1);
   Arrays.sort(strArray2);
   ```
   - Both character arrays are sorted using `Arrays.sort()`. This reorders the characters in **lexicographical (alphabetical)** order.
     - For example:
       - If `s1 = "listen"`, then after sorting, `strArray1 = ['e', 'i', 'l', 'n', 's', 't']`.
       - If `s2 = "silent"`, then after sorting, `strArray2 = ['e', 'i', 'l', 'n', 's', 't']`.

---

3. **Compare the Sorted Arrays:**
   ```java
   return Arrays.equals(strArray1, strArray2);
   ```
   - The sorted character arrays are compared using `Arrays.equals()`. 
     - If the arrays are identical (i.e., contain the same characters in the same order), the strings are anagrams, and the method returns `true`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input:
```java
String s1 = "listen";
String s2 = "silent";
```

#### Execution:
1. Convert to character arrays:
   ```java
   strArray1 = ['l', 'i', 's', 't', 'e', 'n'];
   strArray2 = ['s', 'i', 'l', 'e', 'n', 't'];
   ```

2. Sort the arrays:
   ```java
   strArray1 = ['e', 'i', 'l', 'n', 's', 't'];
   strArray2 = ['e', 'i', 'l', 'n', 's', 't'];
   ```

3. Compare:
   ```java
   Arrays.equals(strArray1, strArray2) => true
   ```

#### Output:
```java
true
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - Sorting both arrays: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings.
   - Comparing arrays: \(O(n)\).
   - Overall: \(O(n \log n)\).

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - Space used for the character arrays: \(O(n)\).

---

### Limitations:
1. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - This implementation is case-sensitive. For example, `"Listen"` and `"Silent"` would not be considered anagrams.
   - To make it case-insensitive, you can convert both strings to lowercase using `s1 = s1.toLowerCase();` and `s2 = s2.toLowerCase();` before processing.

2. **Handling of Special Characters:**
   - Non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) are treated as part of the string. To ignore these, you'd need to preprocess the strings.
